**Overview**

We introduce 'first move first' (FMF), a deterministic search strategy for high-branching-factor game trees where initial decisions dominate path quality. Unlike standard depth-first search (DFS), which backtracks incrementally from leaf nodes to explore sibling branches, FMF systematically prioritizes the first unexplored successor at each node before backtracking to the earliest incompletely explored ancestor, requiring no heuristics or auxiliary data structures.

**Motivation**

The algorithm was developed for Beleaguered Castle, a solitaire game where early moves critically shape the game state, while late-game foundation-building moves exert minimal influence on winning paths. For difficult deals, solvability is typically resolved early, motivating efficient path discovery over optimality.

First-move-first traversal systematically explores these critical early decisions, avoiding the inefficiencies of depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), which become trapped in suboptimal branches when seeking any viable winning path among potentially long solution trajectories.
